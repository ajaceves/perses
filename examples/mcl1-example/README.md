# MCL1 protein-ligand example

This folder contains an example setup for a protein-ligand relative free energy calculation.

## Origin of input files

The input files in this directory are from the Schrodinger JACS dataset, with the protein pdb fixed using [PDBFixer](https://github.com/pandegroup/pdbfixer).

## File description

* MCL1_protein_fixed.pdb: PDB file for MCL1 structure from JACS benchmark (cited below) run through PDBFixer.

* MCL1_ligands.sdf: SDF file of MCL1 ligands from JACS structure

* mcl1_nonequilibrium.yaml: Example configuration file for running MCL1 relative free energy calculations with nonequilibrium switching

* mcl1_sams.yaml: Example configuration file for running MCL1 relative free energy calculations with SAMS.

## Running example

The example can be run by calling `python ../../scripts/setup_relative_calculation.py mcl1_sams.yaml`. By default, the included yaml file directs the code to set up and run the solvent phase. 

The options for the run are contained in the `yaml` file passed to the `setup_relative_calculation.py` script. There are two examples provided,
`mcl1_sams.yaml` and `mcl1_nonequilibrium.yaml`, which allow the user to run either a SAMS or nonequilibrium switching-based free energy calculation, respectively.
