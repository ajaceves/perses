# MCL1 transdimensional nonequilibrium switching example

## Setup

### Forcefield

Before running any simulations, first generate the requisite forcefield file:
```bash
python generate_forcefields_from_molfile.py MCL1_ligands.sdf MCL1_ligands.xml
```

### Complex system parameterization

To parameterize the MCL1 systems for equilibrium simulation (which precedes the nonequilibrium switching experiments),
run:
```bash
python run_equilibrium_setup.py input_options_complex.yaml
```

where `input_options.yaml` contains the options (such as output directories) for simulation. See the example file for more details

This script will generate stored numpy arrays containing initial positions, an `mdtraj.Topology` object and an `openmm.System` object.
All systems are solvated to the same number of waters. 

## Run equilibrium simulations

Before running the transdimensional nonequilibrium switching calculations, we generate a cache of equilibrium samples.
To do this, run:
```bash
python run_equilibrium.py input_options_complex.yaml [index]
```

where `input_options.yaml` is the same as the one used in the setup, and `index` is the index (starting at 1)
of the system to simulate. Having the index as a command-line parameter makes it straightforward to
run as an array job (whose indices start at 1 for LSF).

## Run transdimensional nonequilibrium switching

After generating the equilibrium cache, run the transdimensional nonequilibrium switching experiments by:

```bash
python run_nonequilibrium.py input_options_complex.yaml [job_index] [n_maps]
```

Similarly to the equilibrium run command, we give the same `input_options.yaml` file that we've been using.
The job index indicates which calculation this job should run. The integer division of the job index by the number of maps gives the
index of the pair, while the remainder of this division specifies which map index should be used. `n_maps` specifies the number of maps
to use for each pair. If there are fewer than `n_maps` for a given pair, the index wraps around.


The output files will be placed in the directory specified in the configuration file. The output is a numpy array that is named:
`project_prefix_initial_ligand_proposal_ligand.npy`, and contains an array of size: `[n_iterations, 7]`

The components of each iteration are:

```pythonstub
        results[i, 0] = initial_logP
        results[i, 1] = logP_reverse
        results[i, 2] = final_logP
        results[i, 3] = logP_work
        results[i, 4] = initial_hybrid_logP
        results[i, 5] = final_hybrid_logP
        results[i, 6] = logP_geometry_forward
```

# Solvent phase

To run the solvent phase, simply repeat the steps above but with the `input_options_solvent.yaml` file.
Note that the directory for output that you specify there (or the prefix for the filenames) should be different
from the complex phase, otherwise one may overwrite another.
